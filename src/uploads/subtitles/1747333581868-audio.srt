Hey there, this is a quick and silly video to allow you to experiment a little bit with

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
the process of transcription on YouTube.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,240
All I'm looking for you to do here is to use the YouTube tool to transcribe this message

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,840
and then click sync and set the time in so you can get a quick idea about how the whole

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
process works.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,800
Well, this wraps up the video, good luck, and I will talk to you about it soon.
